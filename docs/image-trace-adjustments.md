# Adjusting an Image Trace

Select a placed raster image, then choose **Image Trace** or a preset from its arrow
in Properties or the Control bar. The original image stays inside the tracing object so
that subsequent adjustments always use the original pixels.

To adjust the result, select the tracing object and click **Image Trace** in Properties or the
image icon in the Control bar: the Image Trace panel opens with **Advanced** expanded. An existing floating or docked panel is activated in
its current location. Opening the controls does not add a document undo step.

| Control | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Threshold (Black and White) | 0–255 | Higher values include lighter pixels as black ink. |
| Paths | 0–100% | Higher values fit outlines more closely to the image. |
| Corners | 0–100% | Higher values preserve more sharp turns. |
| Noise | 1–100 px | Suppresses small connected regions; higher values remove more small details. |
| Method | Abutting / Overlapping | Chooses shared boundaries or stacked overlapping paths. |
| Create | Fills / Strokes | Creates filled areas, stroked lines, or both. |
| Ignore Color | Color picker | Leaves out the selected color (white by default). |

Sliders apply on release, and their numeric fields can be edited directly. Each committed
adjustment re-traces the selected object as one undo step and changes the preset to Custom.
While dragging, the preset and Enhanced row stay in place until release so the
slider retains its active interaction. Committed settings are synchronized immediately,
so Undo also restores the panel values before its next frame. View can show the source image, the result, outlines, or combinations without re-tracing.
Use **Expand** when finished to turn the result into ordinary editable vector objects;
after expanding, the tracing settings are no longer available. **Release** restores the source.

These controls use VectorCraft's existing tracing algorithm. Parameter effects follow its
implementation; they do not claim pixel-identical results with another application.
The terminology and general control behavior are described in the
[public Image Trace panel documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/desktop/manage-objects/traces-mockups-symbols/image-trace-panel-options.html).

Regression coverage: `crates/ui-egui/src/panels/image_trace.rs` tests opening the panel,
a quick trace leaving it as it was, repeated opening, floating ownership, slider commits, visible threshold
changes, undo, and the Properties entry point. Tracer tests live in `crates/trace/src/tests.rs`.
